# About me 
Hi :wave:, I am Riddhiman and a long time `R` user. This blog is my way of sharing things that other people might find helpful (hopefully :sweat_smile:). The *R programming language* has been my tool of choice so far primarily due to the rich ecosystem that it provides (data/modelling/reporting/application development/documentation/pipelines). 

- Built with :heart: using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Axiom](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom)(theme) and  [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)(deployment)

- All of the above was managed within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) :metal:
