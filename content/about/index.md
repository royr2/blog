# About me 
Hi :wave:, I am Riddhiman and I dabble in analytics and quantitative methods. This blog is my way of sharing things that other people might find helpful (hopefully :sweat_smile:). The *R programming language* has been my tool of choice so far primarily due to the rich ecosystem that it provides (data/modelling/reporting/application development/documentation/pipelines).
