This approach is particularly valuable in credit risk modeling for two key reasons:\n\n1. **Model Stability**: Monotonic relationships add robustness to models, making them less susceptible to overfitting and more reliable when deployed in production\n2. **Interpretability**: Monotonic relationships are easier to explain to stakeholders and regulators, as they ensure consistent and logical relationships between variables and outcomes\n\n## Required Libraries\n\nWe'll use the following R packages for this demonstration:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(recipes)  # For data preprocessing\nlibrary(dplyr)    # For data manipulation\nlibrary(xgboost)  # For creating monotonic bins\nlibrary(ggplot2)  # For visualization\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Sample Dataset\n\nFor this demonstration, we'll use a sample from the Lending Club dataset, which contains loan information including whether loans defaulted:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load sample data from Lending Club dataset\nsample <- read.csv(\"https://bit.ly/42ypcnJ\")\n\n# Check dimensions of the dataset\ndim(sample)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 10000   153\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Creating a Target Variable\n\nFirst, we need to create a binary target variable that indicates whether a loan defaulted (1) or not (0):\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define loan statuses that represent defaults\ncodes <- c(\"Charged Off\", \"Does not meet the credit policy. Status:Charged Off\")\n\n# Create binary target variable\nmodel_data <- sample %>%\n  mutate(bad_flag = ifelse(loan_status %in% codes, 1, 0))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Data Preparation\n\nNext, we'll preprocess the data using the `recipes` package to:\n1. Select only numeric variables\n2. Impute missing values with median values\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a recipe for preprocessing\nrec <- recipe(bad_flag ~ ., data = model_data) %>%\n  step_select(where(is.numeric)) %>%  # Keep only numeric variables\n  step_impute_median(all_predictors())  # Fill missing values with medians\n\n# Apply the preprocessing steps\nrec <- prep(rec, training = model_data)\ntrain <- bake(rec, new_data = model_data)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Analyzing Directional Trends\n\nBefore creating monotonic bins, it's helpful to visualize the raw relationship between a predictor variable and the target. Let's examine how the number of credit inquiries in the past 6 months relates to default rates:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create dataframe with inquiries and default flag\ndata.frame(x = model_data$inq_last_6mths,\n           y = model_data$bad_flag) %>%\n  filter(x <= 5) %>%  # Focus on 0-5 inquiries for clarity\n  group_by(x) %>% \n  summarise(count = n(),  # Count observations in each group\n            events = sum(y)) %>%  # Count defaults in each group\n  mutate(pct = events/count) %>%  # Calculate default rate\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(x), y = pct)) + \n  geom_col() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"# of inquiries in past 6 months\", \n       y = \"Default rate\",\n       title = \"Default rate vs number of inquiries\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](monotonic-binning-using-xgboost_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNotice that while there's a general upward trend (more inquiries correlate with higher default rates), the relationship isn't perfectly monotonic. This is where our binning approach will help.\n\n## Creating Monotonic Bins with XGBoost\n\nNow we'll leverage XGBoost's monotonicity constraints to create bins that have a strictly increasing relationship with default rates. The key parameter is `monotone_constraints = 1`, which forces the model to create splits that maintain a positive relationship with the target:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Train XGBoost model with monotonicity constraint\nmdl <- xgboost(\n  data = train %>%\n    select(inq_last_6mths) %>%  # Use only the inquiries variable\n    as.matrix(),  \n  label = train[[\"bad_flag\"]],  # Target variable\n  nrounds = 5,  # Number of boosting rounds\n  params = list(\n    booster = \"gbtree\",\n    objective = \"binary:logistic\",\n    monotone_constraints = 1,  # Force positive relationship\n    max_depth = 1  # Simple trees with single splits\n  ),\n  verbose = 0  # Suppress output\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Retrieving Split Points and Creating Bins\n\nAfter training the model, we can extract the split points that XGBoost identified and use them to create our monotonic bins:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Extract split points from the model\nsplits <- xgb.model.dt.tree(model = mdl)  \n\n# Create bin boundaries including -Inf and Inf for complete coverage\ncuts <- c(-Inf, unique(sort(splits$Split)), Inf)\n\n# Create and visualize the monotonic bins\ndata.frame(target = train$bad_flag,\n           buckets = cut(train$inq_last_6mths, \n                         breaks = cuts, \n                         include.lowest = TRUE, \n                         right = TRUE)) %>% \n  group_by(buckets) %>%\n  summarise(total = n(),  # Count observations in each bin\n            events = sum(target == 1)) %>%  # Count defaults in each bin\n  mutate(pct = events/total) %>%  # Calculate default rate\n  ggplot(aes(x = buckets, y = pct)) + \n  geom_col() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Bins\", \n       y = \"Default rate\",\n       title = \"Monotonic Bins for Inquiries\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](monotonic-binning-using-xgboost_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNotice how the default rates now increase monotonically across the bins, making the relationship clearer and more interpretable compared to the raw data we visualized earlier.\n\n## Creating a Reusable Function\n\nTo make this process more efficient for multiple variables, let's create a reusable function that handles the entire binning workflow:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncreate_bins <- function(var, outcome, max_depth = 10, plot = TRUE){\n  # Determine relationship direction automatically\n  corr <- cor(var, outcome, method = \"spearman\")\n  direction <- ifelse(corr > 0, 1, -1)  # 1 for positive, -1 for negative correlation\n  \n  # Build XGBoost model with appropriate monotonicity constraint\n  mdl <- xgboost(\n    verbose = 0,\n    data = as.matrix(var),\n    label = outcome,\n    nrounds = 100,  # Single round is sufficient for binning\n    params = list(objective = \"binary:logistic\",\n                  monotone_constraints = direction,  # Apply constraint based on correlation\n                  max_depth = max_depth))  # Control tree complexity\n  \n  # Extract and return split points\n  splits <- xgb.model.dt.tree(model = mdl)\n  cuts <- c(-Inf, sort(unique(splits$Split)), Inf)  # Include boundaries for complete coverage\n  \n  # Optionally visualize the bins\n  if(plot) {\n    data.frame(target = outcome,\n               buckets = cut(var, \n                            breaks = cuts, \n                            include.lowest = TRUE, \n                            right = TRUE)) %>% \n      group_by(buckets) %>%\n      summarise(total = n(),\n                events = sum(target == 1)) %>%\n      mutate(pct = events/total) %>%\n      ggplot(aes(x = buckets, y = pct)) + \n      geom_col() + \n      theme_minimal() + \n      labs(x = \"Bins\", \n           y = \"Default rate\",\n           title = \"Monotonic Bins\")\n  }\n  \n  return(cuts)  # Return the bin boundaries\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Example Usage\n\nYou can use this function to create monotonic bins for any numeric variable by passing the variable and outcome columns:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Example: Create monotonic bins for annual income\nincome_bins <- create_bins(\n  var = train$annual_inc,\n  outcome = train$bad_flag,\n  max_depth = 5\n)\n```\n:::\n",
